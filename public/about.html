<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm an ENFP and a Gemini, which basically means I'm fueled by curiosity,
  creativity, and a love for deep conversations (or the occasional spontaneous
  adventure). Life’s too short for anything less than excitement!
</p>

<p>
  I’m a business owner at SalmonFit.com, where I mix my love for food and
  entrepreneurship. Always on the lookout for new opportunities, fresh ideas,
  and ways to bring value to the table—both literally and figuratively.
</p>

<p>
  I thrive on planning, creating, and making things happen, whether it’s in
  business, my role as a Commissioner, or just exploring new passions. A big fan
  of spicy and savory food, so if there’s something with a kick, I’m all in!
